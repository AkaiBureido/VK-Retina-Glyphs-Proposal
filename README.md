VK-Retina-Glyphs-Proposal
=========================

###The Author:

Oleg Utkin



###Description:	

I took the glyphs from Glyphish collection and modified them to suit the style of VK app.
It should work plug and play, just add it to your resources, no code needed, I followed the naming conventions. Also it will not substitute any files you already have, unless you started to work on higher resolution glyphs yourself.
